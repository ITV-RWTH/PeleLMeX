## EB\_ODEQty
This RegTest contains two test cases that demonstrate the use of user defined external source terms:
1. `prob_parm.ode_qty_test = true`: A 2D inflow/outflow case with an optional EB cylinder in the middle of the flow. This demonstrates how to use `ProblemSpecificFunctions` and the ODE quantities.  The ODE quantities experience simple exponential decay that gets stiffer for each quantity.  Specifically, $\frac{\partial B_k}{\partial t} = \gamma \cdot 10^{k+1} B_k$, for $k = 0, 1,\dots,$ NUM_ODE and $\gamma < 0$.
2. `prob_parm.composition_test = true`:  This case tests the implementation of the user defined external sources for density, $\rho$, and the species $Y_m$.  The flow is set to zero with initial mass fractions $Y_{CO_2} = 0.15$, $Y_{N_2} = 0.25$ and $Y_{AR} = 0.6$.  After $t_s$ seconds, CO2 is added via an external source at a rate of $S_{ext,\rho Y_{CO_2}}$ kg/m$^3$/s.  Since CO2 is being added to the domain, density will increase at a rate of $S_{ext,\rho} = S_{ext,\rho Y_{CO_2}}$.  Results are compared to analytical solutions in `plot-comps.py` and tested in the CI via `test.py`.
